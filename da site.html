<H1>THIS WEEK'S ARTICLE:Schrems case nightmare becomes true for US FTC - Privacy Shield precipitates, Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) stays, interim way forward with SCC</H1>
<P>Schrems case I invalidated, in October 2015, Safe Harbor and the EU and US started Privacy Shield. On July 16, 2020, Schrems case II invalidated Privacy Shield. The EU's Adequacy Decision vehicle for US, the Privacy Shield, just precipitated overnight. Thanks to the efforts of Max Schrems, the Austrian author and privacy rights activist.

European Court of Justice (ECJ) has allowed Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as the viable instrument for tranferring personal data from European Economic Area (EEA) to non-EEA countries, with an opportunity to reloook at the effectiveness of SCC (in the context of the strength of Privacy Laws in the data recipient country).

Privacy Officers can provide for this by:

Agreeing (in the SCC) to EU/EEA jurisdiction for all disputes arising out of the Data Processing, the Data Processing Agreement (DPA) and SCC.
Agreeing to add clauses that will make up for the inadequacy of protection in the privacy laws of the data recipient country in question or for the absence of laws.
As a matter of fact,

SCC is being used as an instrument for cross-border data transfer even before Safe Harbor came in to being.
Privacy regulations of most other countries also depend on SCC or instruments similar to SCC.
As a matter of fact, US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has notified all Privacy Shield compliant firms to continue to adhere to the Privacy Shield controls, which is the right thing to do for FTC, reason being, many companies of the EEA member nations have allowed cross border data transfer to US based on Privacy Shield credentials of the data recipient firms in the US.

Only the EU, Japan and Malaysia and few other countries have an Adequacy Decision kind of model and these Adequacy Decisions are driven and granted to specific countries, many times for reasons not related to Privacy, but for reasons related to GeoPolitical conveniences.</P>
